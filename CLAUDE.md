# HMS — Home Management System

## Project Overview
HMS is a family household management app for managing rental properties (2 grounds, ~15 rooms), electricity monitoring, water bills, household inventory, children's school expenses, and family finances. Built for daily use on Android by a small family (2-3 users).

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Flutter 3.41.x (Dart 3.11.x) — Android only
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore + Auth) — Spark plan (free tier)
- State Management: Riverpod 3.x with code generation (@riverpod + riverpod_generator)
- Routing: GoRouter with type-safe named routes and role-based guards
- Models: Freezed + json_serializable (immutable, auto JSON serialization)
- Notifications: flutter_local_notifications (100% local, no Cloud Functions)
- Charts: fl_chart for consumption and financial graphs
- Offline: Firestore native offline persistence (enablePersistence)
- NO Firebase Storage — contract photos stored locally on device only

## Architecture Pattern — FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY

## Module Pattern — Every feature follows this:
- **models/** — Freezed data classes with @freezed annotation, part files for .freezed.dart and .g.dart
- **providers/** — @riverpod annotated providers and notifiers, part files for .g.dart
- **screens/** — ConsumerWidget or ConsumerStatefulWidget (NOT StatefulWidget)
- **widgets/** — Module-specific reusable widgets

## Riverpod Rules
- Use @riverpod annotation for ALL providers (code generation, not manual)
- Use `Ref` parameter (Riverpod 3.x style), NOT the old `ref` on build
- Shared providers live in core/providers/ (currentGroundProvider, authStateProvider, connectivityProvider)
- Module providers live in features/<module>/providers/
- Use AsyncNotifier for anything involving Firestore queries
- Use StreamProvider for real-time Firestore listeners (e.g., alert feeds)
- Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after creating/modifying providers or models

## Firestore Rules
- Use SUBCOLLECTIONS, not flat top-level collections
- Path pattern: grounds/{groundId}/rental_units/{unitId}/meter_readings/{readingId}
- Every document includes: schemaVersion (int), createdAt (Timestamp), updatedAt (Timestamp), updatedBy (String)
- camelCase for all Firestore field names
- Queries scoped by groundId using the currentGroundProvider

## Data Validation Rules
- Phone numbers: Tanzanian format (07XX or 06XX, 10 digits)
- National ID: 20 characters (NIDA format)
- Currency: TZS, always positive, formatted with thousand separators
- Meter readings: current must be >= previous (unless meter reset confirmed)
- Dates: lease end > move-in date, due dates in the future

## UI Rules
- Use Design System components from core/widgets/ — never build one-off cards or tiles
- Every form uses QuickForm pattern: smart defaults, numeric keyboard for amounts, max 30 seconds to complete
- One-tap actions for common operations (mark rent paid, update stock quantity)
- Confirmation dialogs ONLY for destructive actions (delete), never for saves
- Success feedback via snackbar, not blocking dialogs
- Support light and dark themes
- Currency display: TZS throughout, formatted with intl package

## Offline Behavior
- Firestore offline persistence enabled at app startup
- All screens must render from Firestore cache when offline
- All forms must submit offline (Firestore queues writes automatically)
- OfflineBanner widget shows connectivity state
- Local notifications work regardless of connectivity

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all calculation logic (consumption, tariffs, budgets, health score)
- Unit tests for all Firestore service methods
- Widget tests for all Design System components
- Integration tests for core flows (login → dashboard → record data)

## Build & Deploy
- Single APK build: flutter build apk --release
- Version format: v*.*.* in pubspec.yaml
- Run `dart format .` before committing
- Run `flutter analyze` — must pass with zero issues
- Run `flutter test` — all tests must pass

## Currency & Locale
- All monetary values in TZS (Tanzanian Shillings)
- Date format: dd/MM/yyyy
- Time format: 24-hour (HH:mm)
- Locale: en_TZ where applicable

## Git Workflow — MANDATORY
- EVERY phase, feature, or setup task gets its own branch
- Branch naming: `setup/claude-config`, `phase-0/foundation`, `phase-0.5/design-system`, `phase-1/auth`, `feature/rent-tracking`, `fix/meter-validation`, etc.
- NEVER commit directly to `main` — always branch, build, test, then merge
- Workflow for every task:
  1. `git checkout -b <branch-name>` — create branch from main
  2. Do the work, commit with descriptive messages along the way
  3. Run format, analyze, test — all must pass
  4. `git checkout main && git merge <branch-name>` — merge to main
  5. `git push origin main` — push to remote
  6. `git branch -d <branch-name>` — clean up local branch
- Commit message format: `phase-X: short description` (e.g., `phase-0: scaffold project structure and configure Riverpod`)
- Push to GitHub after every completed phase/feature merge to main

## GitHub & Authentication
- GitHub tokens are configured in the shell environment (~/.bashrc or /bin/bash profile)
- Git credentials are already set up — do NOT ask for tokens or authentication
- If a git push fails with auth errors, remind me to check my token instead of trying to fix it yourself
- Remote origin: https://github.com/MussaJabir/hms.git

## Claude Skills — USE THEM
- Always check for and utilize any globally installed Claude skills available in ~/.claude/skills/
- Before writing code for common patterns (frontend design, document generation, etc.), check if a relevant skill exists that provides best practices
- Skills help prevent mistakes — always prefer skill-guided approaches over improvising
- If a skill conflicts with HMS-specific rules in this CLAUDE.md, the HMS rules take priority

## Available Global Skills (check ~/.claude/skills/)
- flutter-dependency-updater — use when checking/updating pubspec.yaml dependencies
- tdd — use for all new features and bug fixes (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
- frontend-design — use when building UI components (check against Design System rules above)
- ui-ux-pro-max — use for complex UI/UX design decisions
- tech-debt-tracker — use periodically to assess code quality
- planning-with-files — use for multi-step phase planning
- tourism-saas — relevant if HMS expands to property management SaaS
- dependency-auditor — run before any major release
- performance-profiler — use if app feels slow

## DO NOT
- Use Firebase Storage (we're on Spark plan, Storage requires Blaze)
- Use Cloud Functions (all notifications are local)
- Use Provider package (we use Riverpod, not Provider)
- Use Hive or Isar (Firestore handles offline caching natively)
- Create manual providers — always use @riverpod code generation
- Use snake_case for Firestore field names (use camelCase)
- Build custom widgets when a Design System component exists
- Skip the schemaVersion field on any Firestore document
- Suggest paid services or packages
- Commit directly to main — always use feature/phase branches
- Ask for GitHub tokens or credentials — they're already configured in the shell
